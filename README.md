About this app:
---------------
This is an open source app to help develolpers learn how to quickly build biNu apps using the biNu-application-framework (https://github.com/tkembo/biNu-application-framework--PHP/).

This app will show you the thousands of similar laws. One thing I have learnt about these Laws though is that they are always true.  
This app shows the user 10 Murphy's Laws at a time in the category the user has selected.

Instructions:
------------
Create a database and import the sql/binu_murphyslaws.sql file into your database.
Edit inc/config.php to enter your database settings.
